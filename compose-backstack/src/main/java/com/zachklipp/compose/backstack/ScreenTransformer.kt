/**
 * Defines a function, [transformScreen], that is applied to every screen in the active backstack
 * at all times.
 *
 * This can be used to define transition animations (see [BackstackTransition] and
 * [AnimatedBackstackTransition]), or other effects on the entire stack.
 *
 * Implementations of this class by doing two things:
 *
 * 1. Indicate whether the screen is actually going to be rendered. If it's not rendered, then the
 *    [Backstack] can clean up resources, including removing the screen's composable from the
 *    composition or removing old screens from the active stack.
 * 2. If the screen is to be shown, then specify a [Modifier] to apply to the screen's composable.
 *    This can be any modifier, and can perform virtually unlimited effects on the screen.

     * ## Lifecycle and Scoping
     *
     * This composable will remain in the composition, in a consistent position, as long as its
     * screen key remains in the active backstack. This means implementations can use Compose's
     * state mechanisms to store state over the lifetime of the screen, even when it's not being
     * shown.
     *
     * Note that [screenIndex] will change if the screen's key is moved around in the stack.Ã¸
     *
     * ## Transitions
     *
     * If a transition is in progress, i.e. the backstack changed such that there is a new top,
     * [direction] will be non-null. During transition, screens that are involved in the transition
     * are considered "locked" until this function returns a [ScreenTransformResult.retainScreen]
     * value of false. This allows screens that have been removed from the backstack to be smoothly
     * transitioned away from.
     *
     * It is important to return a value with [ScreenTransformResult.retainScreen] set to false
     * (such as [HideScreen]) when not rendering a screen so that the [Backstack] can clean up
     * unused resources.
